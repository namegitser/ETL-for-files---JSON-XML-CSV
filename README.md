**Project Description: ETL Pipeline for Health Data Standardization**

This Python script implements a robust Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline for standardizing health-related data from diverse sources such as CSV, JSON, and XML files. The project focuses on processing individual records containing information about individuals, including their name, height, and weight.

**Key Components:**

1. **Extraction:**
   - Utilizes Pandas for CSV and JSON files, employing built-in methods for seamless extraction.
   - For XML files, dynamically creates a DataFrame with predefined columns and extracts details using the ElementTree module.
   - The `extract` function iterates through all files with specified extensions, combining extracted data into a comprehensive DataFrame.

2. **Transformation:**
   - Converts height from inches to meters and rounds off to two decimal places.
   - Converts weight from pounds to kilograms and rounds off to two decimal places.
   - The `transform` function applies these conversions to the extracted data, preparing it for integration with the AI model.

3. **Loading:**
   - The transformed data is loaded into a target CSV file, ensuring compatibility with downstream applications.
   - The `load_data` function utilizes Pandas to write the transformed data to the specified target file.

4. **Logging:**
   - Incorporates a logging mechanism to record the initiation and completion of each ETL phase.
   - Timestamps are logged at the beginning and end of the extraction, transformation, and loading phases, facilitating progress tracking and auditing.

**Execution:**
   - The script logs the initialization of the ETL job, proceeds through the extraction, transformation, and loading phases, and concludes by logging the completion of the entire ETL process.

**Usage:**
   - Run the script to initiate the ETL process for health-related data standardization.
   - Monitor the log file ("log_file.txt") for timestamps and messages detailing the progress of each phase.

This ETL pipeline ensures that health data is consistently formatted and prepared for integration into downstream applications, promoting data accuracy and reliability.
