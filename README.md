**Project Description: ETL Pipeline for Diabetes Risk Prediction with AI**

In this project, our startup has developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of predicting an individual's risk for diabetes based on height and body weight. However, the data required for training and inference comes from diverse sources, with some stored in CSV format and others in JSON files. The challenge is to efficiently Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) this heterogeneous data into a unified format suitable for the AI model.

The ETL process is implemented using Python, and the following block diagram illustrates the pipeline's key components. The initial step involves extracting data from both CSV and JSON files. Leveraging Python's `glob` module, we locate all relevant files with specified extensions. The subsequent extraction function processes each file, generating a data frame for both CSV and JSON formats, containing essential information such as names, height, and weight.

The extracted data is then subjected to the Transform step, where unit conversions are applied. Given that the AI model utilizes metric units, we convert height from inches to millimeters and weight from pounds to kilograms. This results in a transformed dataset ready for integration into the AI model.

Following transformation, the data is Loaded into a target file, stored as a CSV for easy compatibility with the AI system. Additionally, a logging function has been incorporated to timestamp the initiation and completion of each step. This logging mechanism aids in tracking the ETL process's progress and ensures a comprehensive record of activities.

The project culminates with the orchestration of these ETL functions, initiated by calling the `extract_data` function, followed by transformation and loading. Timestamps at the onset and conclusion of each step provide visibility into the duration and sequence of operations.

This comprehensive ETL pipeline ensures that our diabetes risk prediction AI model receives consistent, formatted data, thereby enhancing its accuracy and reliability. The incorporation of logging further facilitates monitoring and auditing of the entire process.
